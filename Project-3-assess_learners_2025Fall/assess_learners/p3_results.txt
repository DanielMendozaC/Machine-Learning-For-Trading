Project 3 Experimental Results
================================

Experiment 1 - Overfitting Analysis:
Leaf sizes tested: 1 to 50
Minimum out-of-sample RMSE achieved at leaf_size = 19
Overfitting appears to occur when leaf_size < 19

Experiment 2 - Bagging Effect:
Compared DTLearner vs BagLearner (20 bags)
Bagging generally reduces overfitting and improves out-of-sample performance

Experiment 3 - DTLearner vs RTLearner:
Metrics used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Maximum Error
Results show trade-offs between deterministic and random tree approaches
